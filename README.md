- Ensure your character sheet has proper ownership permissions
- Check that you have at least "Owner" level access to your character

**"Item not found in compendium"**
- Verify the compendium still exists and contains the item
- Try regenerating the vendor's inventory

**"Purchase request not processing"**

- Check that the vendor is still active
- Verify you have sufficient funds

**Items not appearing in inventory**
- Check your character sheet's items tab
